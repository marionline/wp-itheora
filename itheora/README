WHY THIS FORK?
==============

I want to create this project to give to wp-itheora plugin for Wordpress a
new and update video player.

The developers of official itheora project are developing the new itheora
3.
http://itheora.org/dev/
http://itheora.org/en/node/164

Some time ago I start a new fork of itheora version 2.
http://itheora.org/en/node/164#comment-293
I undestand that I should rewrite all the code to implement the new itheora
version 2. So I decide to create this new fork.

I don't see a real much activity on itheora project so I create this
prototype of itheora version 3. I like really much video-js so I want to
use it.
I hope that the itheora team can use my new version of itheora-fork to
release the new itheora version.

P.S. Excuse my bad English
